# Swoosh Permission Model

Swoosh has two independent controls:

- `PermissionProfilePreset` decides which `SwooshPermission` cases the firewall grants.
- `ToolCallPolicy` and `SwooshSafetyConfig` decide whether the model may call tools, whether approvals are required, and whether normally gated capabilities are unlocked.

## Profiles

| Profile | Firewall grants | Tool policy | Safety flags |
|---------|-----------------|-------------|--------------|
| `safe` | Read-only runtime, memory, audit, and network status | Restrictive, low chain depth | Locked |
| `developer` | File, Git, Swift/Xcode, memory, workflow, skills, provider access, game load/observe/generate/evaluate, and `imageGenerate` | Default agent policy | Locked |
| `automation` | Developer plus calendar, reminders, scheduling, app usage, focus signals, game action control, `videoGenerate`, `threeDGenerate` | Default agent policy | Locked |
| `power` | Nearly all permissions except mainnet writes (includes all media-gen) | Critical model calls allowed, approvals still required | Development safety |
| `trader` | Developer plus chain reads/builds/signing/broadcast and mainnet writes | Critical + human-only model calls allowed with approvals | Trader safety |
| `autonomous` | Every `SwooshPermission` case | Full model tool access, high limits, approvals optional | All safety flags enabled |
| `custom` | Developer defaults until edited | Default agent policy | Locked |

`autonomous` is intentional: it is the explicit opt-in for unattended agents that can run without human approval. Safe modes remain available and are still the default unless the user chooses otherwise.

## Runtime Policy Fields

`ToolCallPolicy` is enforced by the agent loop and registry:

| Field | Effect |
|-------|--------|
| `maxToolCallsPerTurn` | Total tool calls allowed in one turn |
| `maxToolChainDepth` | Maximum chained model tool-call depth |
| `allowModelToolCalls` | If false, the model receives no tool descriptors and returned tool calls are blocked |
| `allowHumanOnlyFromModel` | If false, human-only tools are hidden from and blocked for model-origin calls |
| `allowCriticalToolsFromModel` | If false, critical-risk tools are hidden from and blocked for model-origin calls |
| `requireApprovalForMediumRiskAndAbove` | If true, model-origin medium, high, and critical calls require approval even when a tool itself says `never` |

`SwooshSafetyConfig` gates advanced capabilities:

| Flag | Capability |
|------|------------|
| `autonomousTradingEnabled` | Autonomous trading workflows |
| `swapExecutionEnabled` | DEX swap execution |
| `portfolioRecommendationsEnabled` | Portfolio recommendation tools |
| `privateKeyCustodyEnabled` | Private-key custody in Keychain |
| `seedPhraseIngestionEnabled` | Seed phrase ingestion |
| `cookieIngestionEnabled` | Browser cookie ingestion |
| `shellToBlockchainBridgeEnabled` | Shell-to-wallet escalation path |
| `modelSelfApprovalEnabled` | Model-origin calls can bypass approval prompts |
| `mainnetWritesByDefault` | Mainnet write permissions can be granted by default |

## Surfaces

- Setup: `swoosh setup quick --permissions <safe|developer|automation|power|autonomous|custom>`.
- CLI status: `swoosh permissions --status` prints the active profile, tool policy, and key safety flags.
- macOS dashboard: Settings shows runtime config, every `ToolCallPolicy` field, and every `SwooshSafetyConfig` flag.
- iOS companion: Settings reads `/api/runtime/config` and shows the paired Mac daemon profile, tool policy, and safety flags.

## Media generation permissions

Four permissions gate the post-LLM media surface. Distinct cases let a user grant chat-with-images without also granting shell access or trading. The matching tool wrappers — `media.generate_image`, `media.generate_video`, `media.generate_3d`, `media.generate_music` — live in `SwooshToolsets` and register only when a matching provider is wired in `MediaGenDependencies` (the daemon constructs providers from Keychain keys via `MediaGenWiring`).

| Permission | Capability | Cloud requires |
|------------|------------|----------------|
| `imageGenerate` | Text-to-image. Local via Apple Image Playground (macOS 15.2+/iOS 18.2+), cloud via OpenAI `gpt-image-1`. | `networkAccess` for cloud |
| `videoGenerate` | Text-to-video. Cloud-only today via FAL.ai (Veo 3, Kling, Hunyuan Video). | `networkAccess` |
| `threeDGenerate` | Text/image-to-3D. Cloud-only today via FAL.ai (Tripo3D, Trellis, TripoSR). | `networkAccess` |
| `musicGenerate` | Text-to-music. Cloud-only today via Suno (sunoapi.org gateway), ElevenLabs Music, or Stable Audio. | `networkAccess` |

Local-only `imageGenerate` (Image Playground) is granted by `.developer`+. Cloud video, 3D, and music are granted by `.automation`+ since they imply outbound network spend. `media.generate_image` is `askFirstTime` (session-cacheable); the cloud-only video/3D/music tools are `askEveryTime` because every call materially spends API credit.

## Cartridge game harness permissions

Cartridge's game harness is separate from NitroGen. NitroGen remains one possible action policy; Cartridge sessions can also use provider LLMs, scripted policies, or hybrid LLM + NitroGen policies.

| Permission | Gates |
|------------|-------|
| `gameObserve` | `game.list_sessions`, `game.list_integrations`, `game.list_pipeline_templates`, `game.record_observation` — read sessions, integration catalogs, pipeline templates, and record replayable observations. |
| `gameLoad` | `game.load_local_url` — create a harness session for `file://`, `localhost`, loopback, or `*.localhost` game URLs. File URLs also require `fileRead`; HTTP(S) local URLs also require `networkAccess`. |
| `gameAct` | `game.record_action` — record or dispatch game actions from a policy. Granted by `.automation`+ because it can drive gameplay. |
| `gameGenerate` | `game.init_project`, `game.generate_content`, `game.save_pipeline` — initialize starter game projects, attach generated characters, dialogue, items, assets, scripts, content packs, and pipeline graphs. `game.init_project` also requires `fileWrite` when an output directory is requested. |
| `gameEvaluate` | `game.evaluate_session` — write playability, goal-progress, mistake-learning, and exploit-finding evaluations. |

Developer profiles can load local games, observe/test them, and generate artifacts. Automation adds active gameplay control. Power and autonomous inherit the full surface.

## Approval Semantics

`askFirstTime` can be approved for the session. `askEveryTime` always creates a new approval request, even after a session approval. `humanOnly` blocks model-origin calls unless both the runtime tool policy and safety config explicitly opt into autonomous behavior.

Every tool call still passes through `SwooshFirewallActor`, is audited, and records approval state when approval is required.

## Plugin admin permissions

The plugin host (`SwooshPluginRuntime.PluginHost`) gates its lifecycle through four `humanOnly` admin permissions. None of them are ever requested by a plugin manifest — `PluginManifest.validate()` refuses any manifest that tries — and none of them can be invoked by the model. They exist so the user can explicitly opt into installing or running a plugin from the CLI or daemon API.

| Permission | Gates |
|------------|-------|
| `pluginInstall` | Adding a manifest to `~/.swoosh/plugins/`. Plugins start disabled after install. |
| `pluginUninstall` | Removing the plugin directory and dropping the manifest from the registry. |
| `pluginEnable` | Approving the plugin's requested permissions, granting them on the firewall, and bridging the plugin's tools into the `ToolRegistry`. |
| `pluginDisable` | Removing the plugin's tools from the registry and revoking any permissions only this plugin held (baseline grants and grants needed by other enabled plugins are preserved). |

Plugin **tools** declare ordinary `SwooshPermission` cases (`fileRead`, `networkAccess`, etc.) which the user grants when they enable the plugin. Each tool call still routes through `ToolRegistry.execute` → `firewall.require(descriptor.permission)`. There is no `pluginExecute` permission — the per-tool permission is the gate.

The user-facing surfaces for these admin permissions are `swoosh plugin {install,uninstall,enable,disable,list,status}` and the bearer-gated `/api/plugins/*` HTTP routes. The model has no path to either — these routes aren't reachable from inside an agent tool call, and the four admin permissions are excluded from any `PluginManifest.requestedPermissions` by `validate()` so a plugin can't grant itself the right to install other plugins.

## Cartridge Calendar permissions

Cartridge ships its own agent-managed calendar (`SwooshCalendar`) — distinct from the **system** calendar that `calendarRead` / `calendarWrite` gate (Apple Calendar / EventKit, and Scout's aggregate `CalendarSource`). The agent's calendar tools use two dedicated cases so granting one never grants the other.

| Permission | Gates |
|------------|-------|
| `cartridgeCalendarRead` | `calendar_list_events` — list upcoming events on the Cartridge calendar. |
| `cartridgeCalendarWrite` | `calendar_manage_event` — create, update, or remove Cartridge calendar events. |

Both tools route through `SwooshFirewallActor` like every other tool. The tray/dashboard read events over the bearer-gated `GET /api/calendar/events`; the agent mutates them via the write tool. Granted by `.developer`+ profiles alongside the other agent-productivity permissions (skills / goals / manifest).
