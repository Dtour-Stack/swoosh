// SwooshDaemon/DaemonHost.swift — 0.1A In-process daemon handle + errors
//
// The daemon is no longer a separate `swooshd` binary — `SwooshDaemon.start()`
// boots the kernel + HTTP server inside the host process (the macOS app) and
// returns this handle. The host retains it for its lifetime; teardown is the
// process exiting (the app and the agent runtime now share one lifecycle, so
// there is no in-session daemon restart to shut down gracefully).
