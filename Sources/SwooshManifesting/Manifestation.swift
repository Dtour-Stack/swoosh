// SwooshManifesting/Manifestation.swift — Swoosh's name for "dreaming" — 0.1A
//
// A Manifestation is one pass of the background self-improvement loop.
// It reads recent audit events, mines for patterns, drafts skill /
// memory candidates, and writes a report. Every pass is durable: the
// `Manifestation` record is the audit trail of what the agent thought
// about while the user was away.
//
// The pillar's name is intentional. "Dreaming" implies the agent is
// hallucinating private state; "manifesting" makes the actual semantic
// load-bearing — the loop turns observed patterns into proposed
// concrete artifacts (skill drafts, memory candidates) that surface in
// the user's review inbox. Nothing the manifester produces takes effect
// until the user approves it.
