// SwooshTools/SensitivePatterns.swift — Shared sensitive-substring redaction — 0.9C
//
// Single source of truth for "this looks like a secret, redact it before
// it lands in audit logs / prompts / MCP responses". Consumed by both
// `SwooshPlugins.PluginContentRedactor` and `SwooshMCP.MCPContentRedactor`.
//
// Adding a new sensitive token here covers every consumer at once — the
// previous design kept byte-identical lists in two modules, which meant a
// new pattern added in one place silently leaked in the other.
//
// The list deliberately uses substring patterns (matched case-sensitively
// against the original content). Redactors that need additional
// context-sensitive rules (e.g. byte-cap truncation) layer those on top —
// `SensitivePatterns.redact(_:)` is the canonical masker; the strings list
// is the floor of patterns it watches for.
